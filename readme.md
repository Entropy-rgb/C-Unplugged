- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows)

##  Compilation and Execution


### Build the Application
```bash
# Standard build
make
```
### Run the Application
```bash
# Method 1: Direct execution
./music_application

```

### Clean Build Artifacts

```
## 🛠️ Makefile Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make` | Build the project with standard flags |
| `make clean` | Remove object files only |

### Known Limitations

1. **Input Format**: Requires CamelCase input (no spaces in names)
2. **Platform**: Best experience on Unix-like systems with ANSI color support
3. **Concurrent Access**: Not designed for multi-user simultaneous access
